# dedicated server

./carsim_no_mlagents.exe -batchmode -nographics

it does not yet work, it looks like it does not properly render the scene

possibly due to some kind of configs for the server

https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/dedicated-server-optimizations.html

seems like some fundamental problem (no rendering --> camera has no good image)

# Windows Standalone

works well (windows_build directory)
